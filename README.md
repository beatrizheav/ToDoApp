# ToDoApp

**ToDo** is an application designed to help users organize, manage, and track their daily tasks efficiently. This system allows managing tasks through an intuitive flow, allowing to assign them different statuses (`to do`, `in progress`, `done`), set due dates, assign priorities and categorize them according to the type of activity. Users can also create their profile and customize it with an avatar.

The system is based on a modern architecture that employs **Firebase** for real-time data management and user authentication, while **Express** serves as the backend for handling API requests.

The application focuses on providing a seamless user experience, filtering tasks by date, status, and priority, and providing a secure and personalized environment for each user.
